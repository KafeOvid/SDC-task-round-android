- A graph showing insight to the spending in the past six days.
- Grouping based on various fields(title, amount, date etc.) to give on overview.
- A popup to enter data and an add button to to add it into the list.
- Deploy this and make this an extension.

### Note

Make sure to use a framework rather than just Vanilla javascript for more points. You can use any framework but you should have good knowledge of the code your wrote.
Please upload the code for your project on GitHub and paste the repo link in the form below.
Also paste the  website link. The website should be hosted on GitHub Vercel (mandatory).
